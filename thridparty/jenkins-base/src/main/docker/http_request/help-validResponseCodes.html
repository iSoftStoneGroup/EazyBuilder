    Configure response code to mark an execution as <b>success</b>.<br/>
    You can configure simple code such as "200" or multiple codes separeted by <b>comma(',')</b> e.g. "200,404,500"<br/>
    Interval of codes should be in format <b>From:To</b> e.g. "100:399".<br/>

    The default (as if empty) is to fail to 4xx and 5xx. That means success from 100 to 399 <b>"100:399"</b>.<br/>
    To ignore any response code use "100:599".
